This folder contains three examples about using roy featherStone's algorithm to compute the dynamics of rigid body systems:

1. Single Pendulum (Step by step)
2. Double Pendulum (Recursive version)
3. Single Pendulum (Recursive version)
Simply Run single_pendulum_dynamics and double_pendulum_dynamics to check the result.

The reference of dynamics equation can be found here:
